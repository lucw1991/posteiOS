## Login and Sign up, with toggle
    - The only file in this directory is LoginView.
    - I kept it as close to how we have it in Kotlin as I could.
        - You can login or signup, controlled by a toggle in the text below the text field entry area.
        - Local UI state track the current more and the values given in the email and password fields. 
        - Dummy buttons will be replaced with input validation when we integrate the backend this semester and we will take out the skip log in button as well.
